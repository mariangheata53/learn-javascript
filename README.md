# Introduction

Programming involves creating a set of instructions, called a program, for a computer to follow. It can be tedious and frustrating at times because computers are very precise and need specific instructions in order to complete tasks.

Programming languages are artificial languages used to give instructions to computers. They are used in most programming tasks and are based on the way humans communicate with each other. Like human languages, programming languages allow words and phrases to be combined to express new concepts. It is interesting to note that the most effective way to communicate with computers involves using a language that is similar to human language.

In the past, the primary way to interact with computers was through language-based interfaces like BASIC and DOS prompts. These have been largely replaced by visual interfaces, which are easier to learn but offer less flexibility. However, computer languages like _JavaScript_ are still in use and can be found in modern web browsers and on most devices.

JavaScript (_JS for short_) is the programming language that is used to create dynamic interaction while developing webpages, games, applications, and even servers.JavaScript started at Netscape, a web browser developed in the 1990s, and is today one of the most famous and used programming languages.&#x20;

Initially, it was created for making webpages alive and was able to run on a browser only. Now, it runs on any device that supports the JavaScript engine.  Standard objects such as `Array`, `Date`, and `Math` are available in JavaScript, as well as operators, control structures, and statements.  _Client-side JavaScript_ and _Server-side JavaScript_ are the extended versions of Core JavaScript.

* _Client-side JavaScript_ enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers. Responses to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation are some of its examples.
* _Server-side JavaScript_ enables access to servers, databases, and file systems.

JavaScript is an interpreted language. While running Javascript an interpreter interprets each line and runs it. The modern browser uses  Just In Time (JIT) technology for compilation, which compiles JavaScript into executable bytecode.
