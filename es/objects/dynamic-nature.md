## Understanding the Dynamic Nature of Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript objects are dynamic, meaning their properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime. This flexibility
allows for powerful and adaptable code but requires careful management to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Adding Properties

You can add properties to an object at any time using dot notation or bracket notation.

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
};

// Adding a new property
person.age = 30;
console.log( person.age ); // Output: 30

// Adding a property using bracket notation
person["gender"] = "male";
console.log( person.gender ); // Output: male
```

### Modifying Properties

Existing properties can be modified by reassigning their values.

```javascript
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla"
};

// Modifying a property
car.model = "Camry";
console.log( car.model ); // Output: Camry
```

### Deleting Properties

Properties can be removed from an object using the `delete` operator.

```javascript
const book = {
  title: "1984",
  author: "George Orwell",
  year: 1949
};

// Deleting a property
delete book.year;
console.log( book.year ); // Output: undefined
```

### Checking for Properties

You can check if an object has a specific property using the `in` operator or the `hasOwnProperty` method.

```javascript
const user = {
  username: "johndoe",
  email: "john@example.com"
};

// Using the `in` operator
console.log( "email" in user ); // Output: true

// Using `hasOwnProperty` method
console.log( user.hasOwnProperty( "username" ) ); // Output: true
```

### Iterating Over Properties

You can iterate over an object's properties using a `for...in` loop.

```javascript
const student = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 22,
  major: "Computer Science"
};

for (let key in student) {
  if (student.hasOwnProperty( key )) {
    console.log( `${key}: ${student[key]}` );
  }
}
// Output:
// name: Alice
// age: 22
// major: Computer Science
```

### Dynamic Property Names

You can use dynamic property names by using computed property names in object literals.

```javascript
const propName = "score";
const game = {
  [propName]: 100
};

console.log( game.score ); // Output: 100
```

### Conclusion

The dynamic nature of JavaScript objects provides great flexibility in managing data structures. You can add, modify,
and delete properties at runtime, check for the existence of properties, and iterate over them. This flexibility, while
powerful, requires careful handling to maintain code stability and predictability.
