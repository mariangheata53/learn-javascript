## JavaScript Behind the Scenes

JavaScript is a versatile language that runs in various environments, including browsers and servers. Understanding how
JavaScript works behind the scenes can help you write more efficient and effective code. This guide covers key concepts
such as the JavaScript engine, execution context, call stack, memory heap, runtime environment, and event loop.

### JavaScript Engine

A JavaScript engine is a program or interpreter that executes JavaScript code. Popular engines like V8 (used in Google
Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used in Safari) parse the code into an Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST), compile it into bytecode or machine code, and then execute it.

### Execution Context

An execution context is an environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. There are three types: global,
function, and eval. Each context has a creation phase, where variables, functions, and the `this` keyword are created,
and an execution phase, where the code is executed line by line.

### Call Stack

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner. It helps
the JavaScript engine manage the execution of multiple functions by pushing and popping function calls as they are
invoked and completed.

### Memory Heap

The memory heap is a region in memory where objects are stored. JavaScript uses garbage collection to manage memory,
automatically freeing up memory that is no longer in use, thus preventing memory leaks and optimizing performance.

### Runtime Environment

The runtime environment provides the necessary resources for JavaScript to execute. In a browser, this includes the
Document Object Model (DOM), Web APIs, and the JavaScript engine. In Node.js, it includes the file system, HTTP module,
and other Node.js-specific APIs.

### Event Loop

The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading tasks to the system kernel whenever
possible. It continuously checks the call stack and processes the callback queue, enabling asynchronous programming and
efficient execution of code.
