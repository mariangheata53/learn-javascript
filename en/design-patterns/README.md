# Design Patterns 

Design patterns are object oriented solutions that you can  implement to solve common programming problems that may occur during the development process. Design patterns are not the same as algorithms, they are a coding concept that you can use to resolve specific kinds of issues.

Today, we will learn about each design pattern and how to implement them using JavaScript. Design patterns can be classified into one of three categories.
