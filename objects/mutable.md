# Mutable

The difference between objects and primitive values is that **we can change objects**, whereas primitive values are **immutable**.

```javascript
let myPrimitive = "first value";
myPrimitive = "another value";
// myPrimitive now points to another string.
let myObject = { key: "first value" };
myObject.key = "another value";
// myObject points to the same object.
```
