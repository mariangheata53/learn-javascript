book will teach you the basics of programming and JavaScript. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the JavaScript programming language.\n\nJavaScript (JS for short) is the programming language that is used to create dynamic interaction while developing webpages, games, applications, and even servers.JavaScript started at Netscape, a web browser developed in the 1990s, and is today one of the most famous and used programming languages. \nInitially, it was created for making webpages alive and was able to run on a browser only. Now, it runs on any device that supports the JavaScript engine.  Standard objects such as Array, Date, and Math are available in JavaScript, as well as operators, control structures, and statements.  Client-side JavaScript and Server-side JavaScript are the extended versions of Core JavaScript.\n\nClient-side JavaScript enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers. Responses to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation are some of its examples.\nServer-side JavaScript enables access to servers, databases, and file systems.\n\nJavaScript is an interpreted language. While running Javascript an interpreter interprets each line and runs it. The modern browser uses  Just In Time (JIT) technology for compilation, which compiles JavaScript into executable bytecode.\n\"LiveScript\" was the initial name given to JavaScript.  \n\n"},"basics/":{"url":"basics/","title":"Basics","keywords":"","body":"Basics\nIn this first chapter, we'll learn the basics of programming and the Javascript language.\nProgramming means writing code. A book is made up of chapters, paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words, and finally punctuation and letters, likewise a program can be broken down into smaller and smaller components. For now, the most important is a statement. A statement is analogous to a sentence in a book. On its own, it has structure and purpose, but without the context of the other statements around it, it isn't that meaningful.\nA statement is more casually (and commonly) known as a line of code. That's because statements tend to be written on individual lines. As such, programs are read from top to bottom, left to right. You might be wondering what code (also called source code) is. That happens to be a broad term which can refer to the whole of the program or the smallest part. Therefore, a line of code is simply a line of your program.\nHere is a simple example:\nlet hello = \"Hello\";\nlet world = \"World\";\n\n// Message equals \"Hello World\"\nlet message = hello + \" \" + world;\n\nThis code can be executed by another program called an interpreter that will read the code, and execute all the statements in the right order.\n"},"basics/comments.html":{"url":"basics/comments.html","title":"Comments","keywords":"","body":"Comments\nComments are statements that will not be executed by the interpreter, comments are used to mark annotations for other programmers or small descriptions of what code does, thus making it easier for others to understand what your code does.\nIn JavaScript, comments can be written in 2 different ways:\n\nLine starting with //:\n\n// This is a comment, it will be ignored by the interpreter\nlet a = \"this is a variable defined in a statement\";\n\n\nSection of code starting with /*and ending with */, this method is used for multi-line comments:\n\n/*\nThis is a multi-line comment,\nit will be ignored by the interpreter\n*/\nlet a = \"this is a variable defined in a statement\";\n\n"},"basics/variables.html":{"url":"basics/variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nThe first step towards really understanding programming is looking back at algebra. If you remember it from school, algebra starts with writing terms such as the following.\n3 + 5 = 8\nYou start performing calculations when you introduce an unknown, for example, x below:\n3 + x = 8\nShifting those around you can determine x:\nx = 8 - 3\n-> x = 5\nWhen you introduce more than one you make your terms more flexible - you are using variables:\nx + y = 8\nYou can change the values of x and y and the formula can still be true:\nx = 4\ny = 4\nor\nx = 3\ny = 5\nThe same is true for programming languages. In programming, variables are containers for values that change. Variables can hold all kinds of values and also the results of computations. Variables have a name and a value separated by an equals sign (=). Variable names can be any letter or word but bear in mind that there are restrictions from language to language of what you can use, as some words are reserved for other functionality.\nLet's check out how it works in Javascript, The following code defines two variables, computes the result of adding the two, and defines this result as a value of a third variable.\nlet x = 5;\nlet y = 6;\nlet result = x + y;\n\nES6 Version\nECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 also known as E6  is a significant update to the JavaScript programming language since 2009. In ES6 we have three ways of declaring variables. \nvar x = 5;\nconst y = 'Test';\nlet z = true;\n\nThe types of declaration depend upon the scope. Unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope, let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in which they are used. For example.\nfunction varTest(){\n    var x=1;\n    if(true){\n        var x=2; // same variable\n        console.log(x); //2\n    }\n    console.log(x); //2\n}\n\nfunction letTest(){\n    let x=1;\n    if(true){\n        let x=2;\n        console.log(x); // 2\n    }\n    console.log(x); // 1\n}\n\nconst variables are immutable - they are not allowed to be re-assigned.\nconst x = \"hi!\";\nx = \"bye\"; // this will occurs an error\n\n"},"basics/types.html":{"url":"basics/types.html","title":"Types","keywords":"","body":"Types\nComputers are sophisticated and can make use of more complex variables than just numbers. This is where variable types come in. Variables come in several types and different languages support different types.\nThe most common types are:\n\nNumbers\nFloat: a number, like 1.21323, 4, -33.5, 100004 or 0.123\nInteger: a number like 1, 12, -33, 140 but not 1.233\n\n\nString: a line of text like \"boat\", \"elephant\" or \"damn, you are tall!\"\nBoolean: either true or false, but nothing else\nArrays: a collection of values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 'I am bored now'\nObjects: a representation of a more complex object\nnull: a variable that contains null contains no valid Number, String, Boolean, Array, or Object\nundefined: the undefined value is obtained when you use an object property that does not exist or a variable that has been declared but has no value assigned to it.\n\nJavaScript is a “loosely typed” language, which means that you don't have to explicitly declare what type of data the variables are. You just need to use the var keyword to indicate that you are declaring a variable, and the interpreter will work out what data type you are using from the context, and use of quotes.\nThe typeof operator is used to checking the datatypes of a variable.  \ntypeof \"John\"                 // Returns \"string\"\ntypeof 3.14                   // Returns \"number\"\ntypeof NaN                    // Returns \"number\"\ntypeof false                  // Returns \"boolean\"\ntypeof [1,2,3,4]              // Returns \"object\"\ntypeof {name:'John', age:34}  // Returns \"object\"\ntypeof new Date()             // Returns \"object\"\ntypeof function () {}         // Returns \"function\"\ntypeof myCar                  // Returns \"undefined\" *\ntypeof null                   // Returns \"object\n\nData types used in JavaScript can be differentiated into two categories based on containing values.  \nData types that can contain values:\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\nobject\nfunction\n\nObject, Date, Array, String, Number, and Boolean are the types of objects available in JavaScript.\n\nData types that  cannot contain values:\n\nnull\nundefined\n\nA primitive data value is a simple data value with no additional properties and methods and is not an object.  They are immutable, meaning that they can't be altered.  There are 7 primitive data types:\n\nstring\nnumber\nbigint\nboolean\nundefined\nsymbol\nnull\n\n"},"basics/equality.html":{"url":"basics/equality.html","title":"Equality","keywords":"","body":"Equality\nProgrammers frequently need to determine the equality of variables in relation to other variables. This is done using an equality operator.\nThe most basic equality operator is the == operator. This operator does everything it can to determine if two variables are equal, even if they are not of the same type.\nFor example, assume:\nlet foo = 42;\nlet bar = 42;\nlet baz = \"42\";\nlet qux = \"life\";\n\nfoo == bar will evaluate to true and baz == qux will evaluate to false, as one would expect. However, foo == baz will also evaluate to true despite foo and baz being different types. Behind the scenes the == equality operator attempts to force its operands to the same type before determining their equality. This is in contrast to the === equality operator.\nThe === equality operator determines that two variables are equal if they are of the same type and have the same value. With the same assumptions as before, this means that foo === bar will still evaluate to true, but foo === baz will now evaluate to false. baz === qux will still evaluate to false.\n"},"numbers/":{"url":"numbers/","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nJavaScript has only one type of number – 64-bit float point.

For example, when you click the reset button it clears the input. \nInteractions from the keyboard such as keypresses need to be constantly read to catch the key’s state before it’s released again.  Performing other time-intensive computations might cause you to miss a key press. This used to be the input handling mechanism of some primitive machines. A further step up is to use a queue, I.e. a program that periodically checks the queue for new events and reacts to it. This approach is called polling.\nThe main drawback of this approach is that it has to look at the queue every now and then, causing disruption when an event is triggered. The better mechanism for this is to notify the code when an event occurs.  This is what modern browsers do by allowing us to register functions as handlers for specific events.\nClick me to activate the handler.\n\n  window.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n    console.log(\"clicked\");\n  });\n\n\nHere, the addEventListener is called on the window object (built-in object provided by the browser) to register a handler for the whole window. Calling its addEventListener method registers the second argument to be called whenever the event described by its first argument occurs.\nEvent listeners are called only when the event happens in the context of the object they are registered on.\n\nSome of the common HTML events are mentioned here.\n\n\n\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nonchange\nWhen the user changes or modifies the value of form input\n\n\nonclick\nWhen the user clicks on the element\n\n\nonmouseover\nWhen cursor of the mouse comes over the element\n\n\nonmouseout\nWhen cursor of the mouse comes leaves the element\n\n\nonkeydown\nWhen the user press and then releases the key\n\n\nonload\nWhen the browser has finished the loading\n\n\n\nIt is common for handlers registered on nodes with children to also receive events from the children. For example, if a button inside a paragraph is clicked, handlers registered on the paragraph will also receive the click event. In case of the presence of handlers in both, the one at the bottom gets to go first. The event is said to propagate outward, from the initiating node to its parent node and on the root of the document.\nThe event handler can call the stopPropagation method on the event object to prevent handlers further up from receiving the event. This is useful in cases like, you have a button inside a clickable element and you don’t want to trigger the outer element's clickable behavior from a button click.\nA paragraph with a button.\n\n  let para = document.querySelector(\"p\"),\n      button = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n  para.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", () => {\n    console.log(\"Paragraph handler.\");\n  });\n  button.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", event => {\n    console.log(\"Button handler.\");\n    event.stopPropagation();\n  });\n\n\nHere, the “mousedown” handlers are registered by both paragraph and button. Upon clicking the button, the handler for the button calls stopPropagation, which will prevent the handler on the paragraph from running.\nEvents can have a default behavior. For example, links navigate to the link’s target upon click, you get navigated to the bottom of a page upon clicking the down arrow, and so on. These default behaviors can be prevented by calling a preventDefault method on the event object.\nMDN\n\n  let link = document.querySelector(\"a\");\n  link.addEventListener(\"click\", event => {\n    console.log(\"Nope.\");\n    event.preventDefault();\n  });\n\n\nlink'sHere, the default behavior of the link upon click is prevented, i.e. navigating towards the link' target.\n"},"regular-expression.html":{"url":"regular-expression.html","title":"Regular Expression","keywords":"","body":"Regular Expression\nA regular expression is an object that can either be constructed with the RegEx constructor or written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in a forward slash (/) characters.

With growing codebase structuring and maintaining the code requires additional work. Though it will pay off in the future, it's tempting to neglect it and allow programs to be deeply tangled. In reality, it increases the complexity of the application, as one is forced to build a holistic understanding of the system and has difficulty to look any piece in isolation. Secondly, one has to invest more time in untangling to use its functionality.\nModules come to avoid these problems. A module specifies which pieces of code it depends on, along with what functionality it provides for other modules to use. Modules that are dependent on another module are called dependencies.  Various module libraries are there to organize code into modules and load it on demand.\n\nAMD - one of the oldest module systems, initially used by require.js.\nCommonJS - module system created for Node.js server.\nUMD - module system that is compatible with AMD and CommonJS.\n\nModules can load each other, and use special directives import and export to interchange functionality, and call functions of each other.\n\nexport - labels functions and variables that should be accessible  from outside  the current module\nimport - imports functionality from outside module\n\nLet's see the import  , and export mechanism in modules.  We have  sayHi function exported from sayHi.js file.\n// 📁 sayHi.js\nexport const sayHi = (user) => {\n  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);\n}\n\nThe sayHi function is consumed in the main.js file with the help of the import directive.\n// 📁 main.js\nimport {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';\n\nalert(sayHi); // function...\nsayHi('Kelvin'); // Hello, Kelvin!\n\nHere, the import directive loads the module by importing the relative path and assigns the sayHi variable.\nModules can be exported in two ways: Named and Default. Furthermore, the Named exports can be assigned inline or individually.\n// 📁 person.js \n\n// inlined named exports\nexport const name = \"Kelvin\";\nexport const age = 30;\n\n// at once\nconst name = \"Kelvin\";\nconst age = 30;\nexport {name, age};\n\nOne can only have one default export in a file.\n\n// 📁 message.js \nconst message = (name, age) => {\n    return `${name} is ${age} years old.`;\n};\nexport default message;\n\n\nBased on the type of export, we can import it in two ways. The named export are constructed using curly braces whereas, default exports are not.\nimport { name, age } from \"./person.js\"; // named export import\nimport message from \"./message.js\"; // default export import\n\nWhile assigning modules, we should avoid circular dependency.

Readers who have an interest in this book are adding this book to their wishlist and are notified when published or even if the release day got postponed too.  On the release day, everyone gets notified and can buy the book making all parties happy.  This is a real-life analogy that happens in programming.  \n\nA \"producing code\" is something that takes time and accomplishes something. Here it's a book writer.\nA \"consuming code\" is someone who consumes the \"producing code\" once it's ready. In this case, it's a \"reader\".\nThe linkage between the \"producing code\" and the \"consuming code\"  can be called a promise as it assures getting the results from the \"producing code\" to the \"consuming code\".\n\nThe analogy that we made is also true for the JavaScript  promise object. The constructor syntax for the promise object is:\nlet promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // executor (the producing code, \"writer\")\n});\n\nHere, a function is passed to  new Promise also known as the executor, and runs automatically upon creation. It contains the producing code that gives the result. resolve and rejects are the arguments provided by the JavaScript itself and are called one of these upon results.\n\nresolve(value):  a callback function that returns value upon result\nreject(error):  a callback function that returns error upon error, it returns an error object\n\nThe internal properties of  promise object returned by the new Promise constructor are as follows: \n\nstate - initially pending, then changes to either fulfill upon resolve  or rejected when reject  is called\nresult - initially undefined, then changes to value upon resolve or error when reject  is called\n\nPromise with resolve and reject callbacks\n\nOne cannot access promise properties: state and result. Promise methods are needed to handle promises.\n\nExample of a promise.\nlet promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // the function is executed automatically when the promise is constructed\n\n  // after 1-second signal that the job is done with the result \"done\"\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done\"), 1000);\n})\n\nlet promiseTwo = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // the function is executed automatically when the promise is constructed\n\n  // after 1-second signal that the job is done with the result \"error\"\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 1000);\n})\n\nHere, the promiseOne is an example of a \"fulfilled promise\" as it successfully resolves the values, whereas the promiseTwo is a \"rejected promise\" as it gets rejected.  A promise that is either rejected or resolved is called a settled promise, as opposed to an initially pending promise. Consuming function from the promise can be registered using the .then and .catch methods.  We can also add  .finally method for performing cleanup or finalizing after previous methods have been completed.\nlet promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000);\n});\n\n// resolve runs the first function in .then\npromiseOne.then(\n  result => alert(result), // shows \"done!\" after 1 second\n  error => alert(error) // doesn't run\n);\n\nlet promiseTwo = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 1000);\n});\n\n// reject runs the second function in .then\npromiseTwo.then(\n  result => alert(result), // doesn't run\n  error => alert(error) // shows \"Error: Whoops!\" after 1 second\n);\n\nlet promiseThree = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\"Whoops!\")), 1000);\n});\n\n// .catch(f) is the same as promise.then(null, f)\npromiseThree.catch(alert); // shows \"Error: Whoops!\" after 1 second\n\nIn the Promise.then() method, both callback arguments are optional.\n\n"},"promise-async-await/async-await.html":{"url":"promise-async-await/async-await.html","title":"Async/Await","keywords":"","body":"Async/Await\nWith promises, one can use a async keyword to declare an asynchronous function that returns a promise whereas the await  syntax makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its value.

With await, we can make JavaScript wait until the promise is settled with its value returned. \nasync function f() {\n  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Welcome to Learn JavaScript!\"), 1000)\n  });\n\n  let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)\n  alert(result); // \"Welcome to Learn JavaScript!\"\n}\n\nf();\n\nThe await keyword can only be used inside an async function.\n\n"},"miscellaneous/template-literals.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/template-literals.html","title":"Miscellaneous","keywords":"","body":"Template Literals\nTemplate literals are literals delaminated with backtick (``) and are used in variable and expression interpolation into strings. \nlet text = `Hello World!`;\n// template literals with both single and double code inside a single string\nlet text = `He's often called \"Johnny\"`;\n// template literals with multiline strings\nlet text =\n`The quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy dog`;\n\n// template literals with variable interpolation\nconst firstName = \"John\";\nconst lastName = \"Doe\";\n\nconst welcomeText = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;\n\n// template literals with expression interpolation\nconst price = 10;\nconst VAT = 0.25;\n\nconst total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`;\n\n \n"},"miscellaneous/hoisting.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/hoisting.html","title":"Hoisting","keywords":"","body":"Hoisting\nHosting is a default behavior in JavaScript of moving declarations at the top.

It transforms a function from callable  f(a,b,c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c). It doesn’t call a function instead it transforms it.\nTo get a better understanding of currying let’s create a simple add function add that takes three arguments and returns the sum of them. Then, we create a addCurry function that takes a single input and returns a series of functions with its sum.\n// Noncurried version\nconst add = (a, b, c)=>{\n    return a+ b + c\n}\nconsole.log(add(2, 3, 5)) // 10\n\n// Curried version\nconst addCurry = (a) => {\n    return (b)=>{\n        return (c)=>{\n            return a+b+c\n        }\n    }\n}\nconsole.log(addCurry(2)(3)(5)) // 10\n\nHere, we can see that both the curried and noncurried versions returned the same result. Currying can be beneficial for many reasons, some of which are mentioned here.\n\nIt helps to avoid passing the same variable again and again.\nIt divides the function into smaller chunks with a single responsibility, making the function less error-prone.\nIt is used in functional programming to create a high-order function.\n\n"},"template-literals/polyfills-and-transpilers.html":{"url":"template-literals/polyfills-and-transpilers.html","title":"Polyfills and Transpilers","keywords":"","body":"Polyfills and Transpilers\nJavaScript evolves every now and then. Regularly, new language proposals are submitted, analyzed, and added to https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/ and then incorporated into the specification. There may be differences in how it is implemented in JavaScript engines depending on the browser. Some may implement the draft proposals, while others wait until the whole specification is released. Backward compatibility issues arise as new things are introduced. \nTo support the modern code in old browsers we used two tools: transpilers and polyfills\nTranspilers\nIt is a program that translates modern code and rewrites it using older syntax constructs so, that the older engine can understand it. For example, \"nullish coalescing operator\" ??  was introduced in 2020, and outdated browsers can’t understand it. \nNow, it’s the transpiler's job to make the nullish coalescing operator” ?? understandable to the old browsers. \n// before running the transpiler\nheight = height ?? 200;\n\n// after running the transpiler\nheight = (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height: 200;\n\n Babel is one of the most prominent transpilers. In the development process, we can use build tools like webpack or parcel to transpile code.\n\nPolyfills\nThere are times when new functionality isn't available in outdated browser engines. In this case, the code that uses the new functionality won’t work. To fill the gaps, we add the missing functionality which is called a “polyfill”. For example, the filter() method was introduced in ES5 and is not supported in some of the old browsers. This method accepts a function and returns an array containing only the values of the original array for which the function returns true\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\nconst filtered = arr.filter((e) => e % 2 === 0); // filter outs the even number\nconsole.log(filtered);\n\n// [2, 4, 6]\n\nThe polyfill for the filter is.\nArray.prototype.filter = function (callback) {\n  // Store the new array\n  const result = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i \ncaniuse shows the updated functionality and syntax supported by different browser engines.\n\n"},"exercises/console.html":{"url":"exercises/console.html","title":"Exercises","keywords":"","body":"Console\nIn JavaScript, we use console.log() to write a message (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in console.
